This project tries to build an object oriented structure for html in PHP.

To include the sourcecode in your project just require
'<PAHT_TO_THIS_PROJECT>/de/maxschuster/htmlhaamr/inc.htmlhaamr.php'.

Or you can create a phar form this project. Just run the make.php an you should
see a new folder called "phar" in the projects root folder. Inside this folder
You will find a "htmlhaamr.phar". If you are running the script with a
webbrowser you could call it with the GET parameter "download"
(http://localhost/htmlhaamr/make.php?download) to automaticly download the phar.

An example can be found in index.php
